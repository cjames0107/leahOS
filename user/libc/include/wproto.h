/* The window protocol: what the server and its clients agree on.
 *
 * There is no message passing here. The whole protocol is one shared memory
 * segment that both sides map and poke at, which is the least machinery that
 * gets a window server out of the kernel: no transport to write, no
 * marshalling, and the pixels are shared rather than copied.
 *
 * The rules that keep that honest:
 *
 *  - A client owns its slot and writes only geometry, title and `present`.
 *  - The server owns the screen and the event rings, and writes only those.
 *  - Slot allocation is the one genuinely contended step, so it goes through a
 *    compare-and-swap on `state` rather than a lock. Whoever wins the swap owns
 *    the slot; everyone else moves on to the next one.
 *
 * The control block is deliberately public - every user can map it - because it
 * is the rendezvous and a client is not root. A window's pixels are not: they
 * stay owned by the client that made them, so one user's windows cannot be read
 * by another. See the note in the README about what that does and does not buy.
